# Budget is:
#   a set of budget items
#
# Budget item is a label paired with a minmum amount (schedule?) and a priority
# priority: necessity (bills), obligation (debt),
#
# What is a profile? A given set of budget item and income schedules
#
# Events occur that change a schedule
#   Ex: lose a job -> stop income schedule, get a raise -> stop income add new one
#
# Scenario:
#   A sequence of events applied to the same profile.
#
# Scenario Analysis:
# If profile change leads some item to go below min, then move money from
# the budget item with the most buffer left/lowest priority
#
# Suggest savings budget items for savings goals.
#
# Front-endy stuff:
#   Mock profile changes that can be saved as a named profile.
#
# Make gems for labels, schedules
